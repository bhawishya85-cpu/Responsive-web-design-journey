# Responsive-web-design-journey
This repository documents my journey of learning Responsive Web Design from the ground up using HTML and CSS. 

I’m focusing on:
-Writing clean, semantic HTML
-Understanding CSS fundamentals deeply (box model, positioning, layout)
-Building responsive layouts step by step (mobile-first thinking)
-Debugging real layout issues instead of copying solutions
-Learning by building and reflecting every day

This repo is not about perfection or frameworks — it’s about consistency, fundamentals, and real learning.
Each commit represents progress, experiments, mistakes, and lessons learned along the way.

Learning in public to stay accountable and grow as a developer.
