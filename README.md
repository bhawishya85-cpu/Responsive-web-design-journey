# 🚀 Responsive Web-Design Journey

This repository documents my daily progress as I master Front-End development, focusing on clean code and modern CSS architecture.

## 🎯 Goal
To transition from "tutorial-copying" to building production-ready UIs, eventually leading to a Full Stack career in the **New Zealand** tech ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML5 (Semantic)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## 📈 Milestone Log

### Day 1: The Foundation
- Learned Box Model properties (`margin`, `padding`).
- Mastered CSS Combinators for precise element targeting.

### Day 2: Flexbox & Interactivity
- **Problem:** Elements stacking vertically due to `display: block`.
- **Solution:** Implemented `display: flex` for horizontal alignment.
- **Added:** Interactive navbar with `:hover` pseudo-selectors.
