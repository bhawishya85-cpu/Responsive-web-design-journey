# 🚀 Responsive Web-Design Journey

This repository documents my daily progress as I master Front-End development, focusing on clean code and modern CSS architecture.

## 🎯 Goal
To transition from "tutorial-copying" to building production-ready UIs, eventually leading to a Full Stack career in the **New Zealand** tech ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML5 (Semantic)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## 📈 Milestone Log

### Day 1: The Foundation
- Learned Box Model properties (`margin`, `padding`).
- Mastered CSS Combinators for precise element targeting.

### Day 2: Flexbox & Interactivity
- **Problem:** Elements stacking vertically due to `display: block`.
- **Solution:** Implemented `display: flex` for horizontal alignment.
- **Added:** Interactive navbar with `:hover` pseudo-selectors.
  
### Day 3: The Box Model and Visual Hierarchy
- learned about Flexbox Layouts, Specificity & Inheritance, and  Image Manipulation.
- **Problem:** Background images (image, llinear greadint) were repeating and not fitting properly in background.
- **Solution:** Instead of a simple image, I mastered Background Properties like size, attachment, position and repeat.
- **Added:** creating a travel card with linear gradient background that have fading effect. This added depth .

### Day 4: Logic and Interactivity 
- Today was about moving from static layouts to "Active" states. I’ve been deep-diving into CSS Pseudo-classes (:hover, :active, :focus, and :visited).
- **Problem:** learning the hard way that using !important and fixed widths (like 1700px) can be tricky for responsiveness.
- **Solution:** i will work on that next day .
- **Added:** I’ve upgraded the intro section of my travel project. Added a image and created a intro page that would grately improve website visually.
